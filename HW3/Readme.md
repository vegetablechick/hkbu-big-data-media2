DJ mag is a British magazine dedicated to electronic dance music and DJs. I scraped global top 100 DJs list from its official website, which show their ranking and in 2017.

The story is to find out the performances of the DJs in 2017. It can be divided into three parts: 

① Their ranking fluctuation on DJmag; 

② The popularity of the DJs in terms of the acceptance of the public instead of the electronic music fans. This can be measured by billboard artist ranking of 2017, the most credible popular music chart; （Replenish new data from Billboard website) 

③ The works of those who got a position on billboard.

And we may finally find out that DJ, or say electronic music  not belongs to the mainstream music type
